	\textit{Allium tenuissimum} L. is a widely distributed perennial herbaceous species in temperate and desert steppes. Relative to other wild \textit{Allium} species, it produces unique sweet flavors, more biomass in arid and cold environments, and has generated greater interest for crop production. Successful crop establishment, however, will depend on rapid and uniform seed germination. Our study aimed to characterize seed germination of \textit{A. tenuissimum} under various temperature regimes (11, 15, 20, 24 and 28 °C) and water potential levels (0, −0.2, −0.4 and −0.6 MPa), and model germination by hydrotime (HT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) analysis. Final germination percentage (FGP) increased within the range of 11 to 20 °C, yet it declined within the range of 24 to 28 °C and generally decreased as water potential became more negative within each temperature setting. Maximum FGP was observed at 20 °C at all water potential settings and ranged from 55.0 ± 5.3 to 94.8 ± 1.4%. According to HT and HTT models, the base (\textit{T}\textsubscript{b}) and optimum temperatures (\textit{T}\textsubscript{o}) for seed germination were 7.0 and 20.5 °C, respectively. In addition, base water potential for the fraction of germination within the seed lot (Ψ\textsubscript{b}(g)) shifted to 0 MPa as temperature increased from \textit{T}\textsubscript{b} to ceiling temperature (\textit{T}\textsubscript{c}). For obtaining 50 % seed germination, Ψ\textsubscript{b}(50) and \textit{T}\textsubscript{c}(50) were estimated to be −0.67 MPa and 27.2 °C, respectively. These values for \textit{T}\textsubscript{b} and Ψ\textsubscript{b}(50) suggest seed germination of \textit{A. tenuissimum} is both cold and drought tolerant and suitable for production in semi-arid regions. Our characterization of the ideal sowing conditions for \textit{A. tenuissimum}, i.e., 20.5 °C and soil water potential less negative than −0.67 MPa offers information to forecast suitable settings to enhance crop production.

	abstract={Germination is the first essential stage in crop and food production, as well as for the establishment of trees and regeneration of wild species. Temperature and water potential are the primary environmental factors that control germination in all species, and affect both the rate and final percentage germination. A comprehensive description of intra- and inter-variations between groups of species (perennials and annuals, trees, grasses, crops and wild species) helps understand where these species are currently able to grow on earth and will be in the future. By collecting germination trait data on 243 species from the literature and unpublished data, we provide a wide spectrum of species{\textquotesingle} seed germination traits, in the form of a set of parameter values describing germination responses to variations in temperature and water potential. Major differences in germination traits were seen to depend on the climatic conditions where the species grow or originated, with species able to germinate on ice and others unable to germinate below 18 {\textdegree}C. By contrast, within the different plant groups, similar ranges of threshold values were found, linked to the species geo-climatic origin. Crops however germinate faster, their range of threshold temperatures and water potential values is wider, and some crops have higher optimum and maximum temperatures as well as lower water potential threshold values. This is likely the result of human selection for rapid germination and for species able to grow in the wide range of environmental conditions where agriculture was developed. Our analyses revealed correlation between traits: negative correlations appeared between germination speed and temperature thresholds, and between temperature and water potential thresholds. The collected data also form a valuable database, enabling plant establishment to be better taken into account in modeling and simulation studies of vegetation boundaries (wild or cultivated) under changing land-use and climate.},
